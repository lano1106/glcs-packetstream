1.0.0 (2014/01/12)
	- Officially forked from original packetstream by Pyry Haulos
	- Optimize branches prediction
	- Use logical short-circuit operators in logical expressions
	- Only set packet size only once all necessary memory has been reserved.
	  This keeps the packet cancellable longer in of an unexpected error.
	- Use monotonic clock with nanosec precision.
